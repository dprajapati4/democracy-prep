### The Challenge

 Create an that app that collects survey data from scholar families.

2. Accurately attribute each response to a scholar with minimal human input or data auditing required.
3.  On a private page provide summary data on responses received to date (e.g. X% of parents answered Y on question Z) that is easy to view at any time
